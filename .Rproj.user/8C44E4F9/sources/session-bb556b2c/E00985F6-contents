# Communicable, Maternal, Neonatal, and Nutritional Disease Burden (CMNN)

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the communicable diseases data
data_cmnn <- read_csv(here("data/burden-of-disease-cmnn.csv"))
```

```{r}
# Filter the dataset to include only the three countries chosen by your group.
data_cmnn_mini <- data_cmnn %>% 
  filter(Entity %in% c("South Africa", "Switzerland", "Angola"))
```

## Table of Estimates for CMNN Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries.
# You should pivot the data wider to show each country in a separate column.
data_cmnn_wide <- data_cmnn_mini %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = `DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`)

kable(data_cmnn_wide, caption = "DALY burden over time for South Africa, Switzerland and Angola")




# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.
```

## Plot Showing Trends in CMNN Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
# NOTE: Use your long 'mini' data frame for plotting, not the wide data used for the table. 

data_cmnn_mini_renamed <- data_cmnn_mini %>% 
  rename(DALYs = `DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`)


daly_plot <-  ggplot(data_cmnn_mini_renamed, aes(x = Year, y = DALYs, colour = Entity)) + geom_line() + labs(title = "DALYs over time for South Africa, Switzerland and Angola",
                                                                                                             )
